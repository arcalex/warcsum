.SH DESCRIPTION

warccollres is part of the \fBwarcsum(1)\fR project.

waccollres uses the digests manifest generated from \fBwarcsum(1)\fR sorted on
the digests column, and compares the content of the WARC members with the same
digest byte-by-byte to decide whether they are duplicates or collisions from
the hashing alogrithm that was used.

warccollres fetches the compressed WARC members from HTTP server(s), and the
URL for each WARC file is fetched from mySQL database containing the WARC
filename and the URL to download that file.
.TP
The digests manifest file contains following data:
     1. Warc file name
     2. Offset (compressed)
     3. End (compressed)
     4. URI
     5. Date
     6. Digest
.TP
The extended digest file contains following data:
     1. Warc file name
     2. Offset (compressed)
     3. End (compressed)
     4. URI
     5. Date
     6. Digest
     7. Digest extension
.TP
If the \fB\-\-proc\fR was used, the extended digests manifest file \
will include:
     8. Copy number
     9. Reference member URI
     10. Reference member date
.TP
The digests manifest line should be in the format:
<WARC filename> <member offset> <member end> <URI> <date> <hash digest>
.TP
The extended digests manifest line should be in the format:
<WARC filename> <member offset> <member end> <URI> <date> <hash digest> <hash
extension>
.TP
The extended digests manifest with additional fields should be in the format:
<WARC filename> <member offset> <member end> <URI> <date> <hash digest> <hash
extension> <copy number> <reference uri> <reference date>

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-input =\fIFILE\fR
Path to input digest file.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-ouput =\fIFILE\fR
Path to output digest file.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-db\-settings =\fIFILE\fR
Path to the file containing the database settings for mySQL connection.
.TP
.BR \-I ", " \-\-input\-buffer=\fINUMBER\fR
The size for the input buffer used to read from temporary files. It can
use the binary suffix \fIK\fR for KiB, \fIM\fR for MiB, and \fIG\fR
for GiB. If no suffix was specified, the value will be in Bytes.

The default value is 8 KiB.

Used without \fB\-\-memory\-only\fR.
.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\-output\-buffer=\fIFILE\fR
The size for the output buffer used to read from temporary files. It can
use the binary suffix \fIK\fR for KiB, \fIM\fRfor MiB, and \fIG\fR
for GiB. If no suffix was specified, the value will be in Bytes.

The default value is 16 KiB.

Used without \fB\-\-memory\-only\fR.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-proc
Resolve the reference of duplicate WARC members. See \fBwarcsumproc(1)\fR.
.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\-memory\-only
use the memory instead of temporary files for processing WARC members.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Explain what is being done.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Do not produce any messages.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
